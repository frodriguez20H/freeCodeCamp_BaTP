        <p>Dian Fossey (January 16, 1932 – c. December 26, 1985) was an American
        primatologist and conservationist known for undertaking an extensive
        study of mountain gorilla groups from 1966 until her death in 1985. She
        studied them daily in the mountain forests of Rwanda, initially
        encouraged to work there by paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey. Gorillas
        in the Mist, a book published two years before her death, is Fossey's
        account of her scientific study of the gorillas at Karisoke Research
        Center and prior career. It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same
        name. Fossey has been called one of the foremost primatologists in the
        world. Along with Jane Goodall and Birutė Galdikas, she is a member of
        the so-called Trimates, a group of the three most prominent researchers
        on primates (Fossey on gorillas; Goodall on chimpanzees; and Galdikas on
        orangutans). The three were sent by Leakey to study great apes in their
        natural environments. During her time in Rwanda, she actively supported
        conservation efforts, strongly opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife
        habitats, and made more people acknowledge sapient gorillas. Fossey was
        brutally murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December
        1985. It has been theorized that her murder was linked to her
        conservation efforts.</p>
